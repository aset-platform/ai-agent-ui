"""Callback package for the AI Stock Analysis Dashboard.

Re-exports the public API so that ``from dashboard.callbacks import X``
continues to work unchanged after the package split.

The original ``dashboard/callbacks.py`` monolith has been refactored into
the following sub-modules:

- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.utils` — pure helpers (validation, market, currency)
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.auth_utils` — JWT validation and API helpers
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.data_loaders` — parquet / registry readers
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.chart_builders` — analysis chart builders
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.chart_builders2` — forecast chart builder
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.card_builders` — stat / target / accuracy cards
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.table_builders` — user / audit HTML tables
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.iceberg` — Iceberg repo singleton
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.registration` — :func:`register_callbacks`
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.routing_cbs` — auth-token and routing callbacks
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.home_cbs` — home-page callbacks
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.analysis_cbs` — analysis and compare callbacks
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.forecast_cbs` — forecast and run-analysis callbacks
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.admin_cbs` — user management callbacks
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.admin_cbs2` — modal and password-change callbacks
- :mod:`~dashboard.callbacks.insights_cbs` — Insights tab callbacks

Example::

    from dashboard.callbacks import register_callbacks
    register_callbacks(app)

That's not valid Python. Let me provide the correct file:
